# What is it?

This is a library providing a decorator to cache the result of a method if given conditions are met.

# How does it work?

The decorator expects to receive an object with a partial of the properties contained in the `CacheCandidateOptions` interface.  
Every non-passed property will be set to its default value using the `CacheCandidateOptionsDefault` object.  
The decorator will return a method that will return a Promise fulfilled with the cached value if the method has already been called with the same arguments and the conditions are met.  
The conditions are, within the given `timeFrame`:

- If a `candidateFunction` is provided, it returns `true` for at least `requestThreshold` times.
- If a `millisecondsThreshold` is provided, it passed such threshold (Execution time) at least `requestThreshold` times.
- If only a `requestThreshold` is provided (default), it is called at least `requestThreshold` times.

## Key composition

The cache key is composed based on the following criteria:

- The class constructor name.
- The method name.
- The arguments passed to the method. (JSON.stringify)
- `instanceIdentifier`: A uniqid generated for each instance of the class. It uses the instance properties to generate the id. (JSON.stringify)
- `uniqueIdentifier`: A uniqid generated to allow multiple files to contain the same class with the same method.

# Other Info

## Constraints

- The decorator can only be applied to methods that return a `Promise`.
- The `candidateFunction` must be synchronous to maintain good performances. If passed an async function bypassing type checking, the candidateFunction will return a Promise thus not working properly.

## Cache Stampede

The decorator prevents the cache stampede problem by using a `Map` called `runningQueries` which saves the promise of the method call.  
If multiple calls are made to the same method with the same arguments, the method will be called only once and the other calls will wait for the Promise to finish.  
The `runningQueries` Map will be cleaned after the method execution is finished.

## Considerations on cache operations

The decorator doesn't consider the correct execution of the given cache methods.  
It isn't the decorator's responsibility to check if the cache methods are working properly.  
The only consideration done is based on the fact that the `set` method will eventually fulfill or reject the Promise as it uses the `.finally` method to delete the key from the `runningQueries` Map and set the timeout to clean the cache record.

## Problems with synchronous methods

If the given method is synchronous, the decorator could not work as expected.  
The reason is that the decorator internally transforms the method to an asynchronous one, so executing the same method multiple times during the same Event Loop tick will prevent the cache from setting the value in time, thus not working as expected.  
The expected result will still be achieved, but please consider the multiple cache set operations during development.

## Considerations on identification

The decorator uses the `instanceIdentifier` and `uniqueIdentifier` to identify the class instance and the method.  
The `instanceIdentifier` is generated using the instance properties, so if the instance properties change, the `instanceIdentifier` will change as well, thus changing the data cache key.  
The `uniqueIdentifier` is generated using the class name and the method name.

## Dictionary

### DataCache

The effective cache instance.

### TimeFrameCache

The Map containing the method executions in a given timeframe.

### RunningQueryCache

The Map containing the running queries (Promises fulfilled or yet to be fulfilled).

### Comparation Value

The value calculated based on candidate conditions which is then compared to the requestThreshold.

# ToDo

- [x] Valutare un forceCandidate che bypassa ogni altro controllo e forza il salvataggio in cache.
- [ ] Rifattorizzare per permettere l'utilizzo in funzioni senza classe.
- [ ] Sostituire le mappe con expiration con le ExpirableMap. --> Non possibile, il comportamento della ExpirableMap differisce troppo.
